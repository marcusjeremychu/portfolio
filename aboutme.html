            <p> I'm a graduate from Singapore with a Bachelor's in Electrical and Computer Engineering with a concentration in Embedded Systems from the University of Washington. My technical background is especially diverse, so I strive to apply this collection of experiences in all the work I do. </p>
            <p> I am passionate about finding and building solutions for difficult problems, and working with teams to achieve them. I have experience in both engineering work and project management, and I am looking to apply my experiences in any field that I can. </p>
